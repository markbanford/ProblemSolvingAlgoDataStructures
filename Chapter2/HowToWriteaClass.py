'''
Each class should have a docstring to provide some level of documentation on how to use the class.

Each class should have a __str__ magic method to give it a meaningful string representation.

Each class should have a proper __repr__ magic method for representation in the interactive shell, the debugger, and other cases where string conversion does not happen.

Each class should be comparable so it can be sorted and meaningfully compared with other instances. At a minimum this means implementing __eq__ and __lt__.

You should think about access control each instance variable. Which attributes do you want to make public, which attributes do you want to make read only,
and which attributes do you want to control or do value checking on before you allow them to be changed.

It's worth noting that if _eq_ is not implemented, then it behaves as "is":
